    "## What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook answers the **central research question**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"Do children whose parents owned their home in 1968 achieve higher educational attainment compared to children whose parents rented?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the prepared dataset from Notebook 01 and:\n",
    "1. Add education variables for children\n",
    "2. Create demographic and control variables\n",
    "3. Apply sample restrictions (age, observability)\n",
    "4. Run three regression models of increasing sophistication\n",
    "5. Generate publication-ready results\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Answer (Spoiler Alert)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes.** Children of homeowners complete approximately **0.9 additional years of education**, even after controlling for race, sex, and parent education.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🎯 Research Question Breakdown\n",

    "- Parent homeownership status in 1968 (own vs. rent)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependent Variable (What we're measuring):**\n",

    "## 📚 Statistical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression** with three models:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 1: Baseline (No Controls)\n",
    "```\n",
    "child_education = β₀ + β₁(parent_homeowner) + ε\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Question:** Is there a raw association between homeownership and education?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 2: Demographic Controls\n",
    "```\n",
    "child_education = β₀ + β₁(parent_homeowner) + β₂(child_race) + β₃(child_sex) + ε\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Question:** Does the association persist after accounting for race and sex?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model 3: Full Controls (Preferred)\n",
    "```\n",
    "child_education = β₀ + β₁(parent_homeowner) + β₂(child_race) + β₃(child_sex) + β₄(parent_education) + ε\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Question:** Is it really homeownership, or just that homeowners are more educated?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Key Concepts for Non-Statisticians\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Regression Coefficient?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple explanation:**\n",
    "\"If we compare two children who are identical in every way except one has a parent who owned their home, how many more years of education does that child complete?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Coefficient = 0.912 means: 0.912 years = ~11 months more school\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Does \"Controlling For\" Mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple explanation:**\n",
    "\"We compare children with similar characteristics (same race, same sex, parents with similar education) to isolate the effect of homeownership alone.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:**\n",
    "Without controls, we might think homeownership causes higher education, when really it's just that homeowners are more educated and pass that on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical Significance (***)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple explanation:**\n",
    "The stars (\\*\\*\\*) mean: \"We're very confident this isn't just random chance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the stars mean:**\n",
    "- *** = p < 0.001 (99.9% confident)\n",
    "- ** = p < 0.01 (99% confident)\n",
    "- * = p < 0.05 (95% confident)\n",
    "- (no star) = Not statistically significant\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "✅ Loaded prepared dataset from Notebook 01  \n",
    "✅ Created analysis variables (binary homeownership, demographics)  \n",
    "✅ Applied sample restrictions (age ≥23, complete data)  \n",
    "✅ Created analysis sample (~17,000 children)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "✅ Compared education by homeownership status  \n",
    "✅ Created distribution plots  \n",
    "✅ Examined sample composition  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical Models\n",
    "✅ **Model 1:** Baseline (homeownership only)  \n",
    "✅ **Model 2:** + Demographic controls (race, sex)  \n",
    "✅ **Model 3:** + Parent education control (PREFERRED)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "✅ Generated publication tables (Stargazer)  \n",
    "✅ Created coefficient plots  \n",
    "✅ Wrote plain-English summary  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Finding\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Children whose parents owned their home in 1968 completed approximately 0.9 additional years of education compared to children whose parents rented, even after controlling for race, sex, and parent education (p < 0.001).**\n",

    "This notebook provides:\n",
    "1. **The Answer** - Yes, homeownership matters (~1 year difference)\n",
    "2. **Statistical Evidence** - Three models with increasing controls\n",
    "3. **Visual Evidence** - Plots showing the difference\n",
    "4. **Professional Output** - Publication-ready tables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggested Book Structure:**\n",
    "- Chapter 2: \"The Results\" - Use Model 3 findings\n",
    "- Chapter 4: \"The Analysis\" - Show the progression (Models 1→2→3)\n",
    "- Appendix: Complete regression tables and technical details\n",

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optional Extensions (Notebook 03):**\n",
    "- Subgroup analyses (Does effect vary by race? By birth decade?)\n",
    "- Robustness checks (Different age cutoffs, alternative specifications)\n",
    "- Additional visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Publication:**\n",
    "- Add these results to your manuscript\n",
    "- Include distribution plot as Figure 1\n",
    "- Include regression table as Table 1\n",
    "- Add coefficient plot as Figure 2\n",
