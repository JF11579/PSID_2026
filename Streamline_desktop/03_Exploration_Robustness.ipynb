    "## What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "After finding that homeownership is associated with ~1 year more child education, we naturally wonder:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Is this finding robust? Does it hold across different groups? What else can we learn from the data?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the data more deeply and tests the robustness of our main finding through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Family Structure Analysis** - How many children did G1 families have?\n",
    "2. **Subgroup Analyses** - Does the effect vary by race? By sex?\n",
    "3. **Cohort Analysis** - Does the effect differ by birth decade?\n",
    "4. **Missing Data Patterns** - Who's missing from our analysis?\n",
    "5. **Alternative Specifications** - Different age cutoffs, model variations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robustness** - Does our finding hold under different assumptions?\n",
    "- **Generalizability** - Does the effect apply to all groups?\n",
    "- **Understanding** - What factors moderate or mediate the effect?\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a \"Robustness Check\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple explanation:**\n",
    "\"Testing whether your main finding still holds when you change how you analyze the data.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Main analysis: Age ≥ 23\n",
    "- Robustness: Try age ≥ 25, age ≥ 21\n",
    "- If results stay similar → Finding is \"robust\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a \"Subgroup Analysis\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple explanation:**\n",
    "\"Checking if the effect differs for different groups of people.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Does homeownership matter more for Black families?\n",
    "- Is the effect stronger for children born in certain decades?\n",
