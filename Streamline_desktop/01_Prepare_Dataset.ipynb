    "# 📊 PSID Data Preparation: From Raw Data to Analysis-Ready Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes us from **raw PSID files** to a **clean, analysis-ready dataset** that links parents (Generation 1, or \"G1\") to their children (Generation 2, or \"G2\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have:\n",
    "- A list of families from 1968 (the parents)\n",
    "- Information about whether those families owned or rented their homes\n",
    "- Their children, born over many years\n",
    "- Education data for those children (measured when they're adults)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Goal:** Connect the dots! Link each child back to their parent's 1968 homeownership status, so we can answer: \"Do children whose parents owned their home do better in school?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Is Tricky\n",
    "\n",
    "PSID doesn't give you a simple \"parent → child\" table. You need to:\n",
    "1. Use **FIMS** (Family Identification Mapping System) to build family trees\n",
    "2. Use the **Data Center** to get actual information (homeownership, education, demographics)\n",
    "3. Carefully merge these together using unique person IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "- How PSID person IDs work\n",
    "- How to link generations using FIMS output\n",
    "- How to merge parent traits (homeownership) with child traits (education)\n",
    "- How to clean and validate your data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before running this notebook, you need:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FIMS Output File** (CSV or Excel → converted to CSV)\n",
    "   - Generated from PSID's online FIMS tool\n",
    "   - Select \"Inter-generational Prospective (GID PRO)\" to link G1 → G2\n",
    "   - This gives you parent-child relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PSID Data Center Extract** (CSV)\n",
    "   - Variables you need:\n",
    "     - `ER30001`: 1968 Interview Number (Family ID)\n",
    "     - `ER30002`: Person Number (Individual within family)\n",
    "     - `ER32000`: Sex of individual\n",
    "     - `ER32006`: Sample/nonsample status\n",
    "     - `V103`: Homeownership status (1968)\n",
    "     - Education variables (added separately)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Google Drive Access** (if using Colab)\n",
    "   - Files should be in: `/content/drive/MyDrive/DATA/PSID_data/`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### PSID Person IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "PSID uses a two-part ID system:\n",
    "- **ER30001**: The 1968 family number (e.g., 2, 3, 4...)\n",
    "- **ER30002**: The person number within that family (e.g., 1, 2, 3...)\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine these into a single unique ID:\n",
    "```\n",
    "person_id = (ER30001 × 1000) + ER30002\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Family 2, Person 1 → `2001`\n",
    "- Family 2, Person 2 → `2002`\n",
    "- Family 345, Person 7 → `345007`\n",
    "\n",
    "This unique ID lets us track individuals across the entire study.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homeownership Variable (V103)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1968, families were asked about homeownership:\n",
    "- **Code 5** = Own home\n",
    "- **Code 8** = Rent home\n",
    "- **NaN** = Missing/unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll convert this to a simple binary:\n",
    "- **1** = Parent owned home in 1968\n",
    "- **0** = Parent rented in 1968\n",
    "- **NaN** = Excluded from analysis\n",

    "- Coded variables\n",

    "2. ✅ **Created person IDs** - Unique identifiers for merging\n",
    "3. ✅ **Merged parent data** - Attached 1968 homeownership status\n",
    "4. ✅ **Merged child data** - Added child demographics\n",
    "5. ✅ **Created analysis variables** - Binary homeownership, cleaned codes\n",

    "3. Update the `FIMS_FILE` and `PSID_FILE` paths to match your downloads\n",
